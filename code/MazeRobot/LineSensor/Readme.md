IR Reflectance Sensor

The IR reflectance sensor detects the reflectance of a surface by using an IR pulse, generated by an IR LED, and measures the amount of IR light that bounces back to a photo-transistor located next to the IR LED. The sensor returns a raw value between 0 and a value set in the program, in our case 3000. The code on the arduino reads this number and based on testing I determined how to manipulate this raw value into a 1 or 0, 1 meaning a line is detected. Because there are 8 sensors this data can be transmitted using a single byte (8 bits). Using i2c this data is transmitted to the pi. The arduino is set as address #08 and is configured as a slave device. Because the arduino is a 5v device and the pi a 3.3v device the pi must be the master as the master sets the voltage for i2c devices. Functions for easily retrieving and manipulating the data on the pi were also written, as well as instructions on how to import them as a library.

Sensor Construction:
Connect data pins from the sensor to pins 2-9 in order on the arduino. Connect the LED on pin of the QTR sensor to pin 10 on the arduino, also connect the gnd connection for the LEDs. Connect the i2c pins of the arduino to the i2c pins of the Pi.

TLDR;
After constructing the sensor use i2c on the Pi read the first byte of data from device #08. This byte represents if a line is detected or not.
