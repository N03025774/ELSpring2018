Utilizing the prebuilt motor chassis and Raspberry Pi the code is downloaded and the MazeRunner.py code run.

Each person in the group had a part delegated to them:

David Schloemer's part was to code the IR reflectance sensor interface, enabling the robot to read the line so Michaels's code can tell the motor when to turn. He also had to attach to line sensor to the robot car and solder the QTR sensor.

Michael Martinez's part was to build the 4-wheel chassis robot car and assemble the cable connection from the battery, and motors to the L293D motor drive chip.

Seraphim Dmitrieff's part was to implement the algorithm to solve the maze and combine all the code such as the motors, line sensor, and the algorithm. Towards the end of the project design, we all try to add any input to solve all the issues in the code to get the robot car to be able to solve the maze.
